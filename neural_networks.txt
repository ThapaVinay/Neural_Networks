			###### NEURAL NETWORKS ######

A neural network is a connected network that takes an input and computes an output.
A Perceptron is an Artificial Neuron and the simplest possible neural network.
Threshold value in neural networks is the delimiter value below which it will be false and above which it will be true.
Perceptron (Neuron) inputs are called nodes. Weights shows the strength of the nodes.
# The activation function maps the resultant weight into a required value like 0 or 1.
